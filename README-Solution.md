## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

It was a lot easier for me. Just an issue with `padding` for the `<a>` which I quickly resolved by using `display:inline-block` because I have encountered that problem before.

### Continued development

I will keep working to improve my use of custom properties.
